# README
These are my implementations of several machine learning algorithms, as shown in [my machine learning blog](https://www.beginningwithml.wordpress.com). The neural network code is largely inspired from the course, "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" on Coursera. I've made some minor changes to make it easier to adapt to more general networks.
